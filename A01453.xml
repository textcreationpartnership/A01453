         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Saint <hi>Luke</hi> hath taken out his image very liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and in a iuſt proportion hath painted him out vnto vs, in his orient colours.

The father is God: theſe his two ſonnes, are two ſortes of people in the Church of God: The one of them orderlie and of good gouernment conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to abide in his fathers houſe &amp; liberties of this church: the other exorbitant, refractorie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall, gadding abroad after his owne fancies, yet humbled by diſcipline, and by chaſtiſement refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The far Country which he traced, was his far departure from his fathers Lawes, by his wicked luſtes. The ſubſtance which he waſted, was the riches of his grace which he deuided to him. The famine hee ſuſtained was the want of the breade of eternall life, and infinite other defectes and wants, vnto which a ſinner is ſubiect when he is gone from God. The cruell tyrant whom hee ſerued was the Diuell whome he obayed: this farme of his which hee attended, was this preſent euill worlde, in the which the Diuell raigneth. The ſwine which he kept were vncleane ſpirits, vngodlie companions, the hearde into which the Deuils doe enter, and doe violentlie throwe into the ſea of all euill. The huskes which rather burdened, then relieued his ſtomacke, were the light and idle vanities of this worlde. His ſinnes wich hee did feede vppon, the alluring baites and inticementes of the Deuill. His returne home was his returne from ſinne by ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy repentaunce: his welcome home was the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb facs="tcp:6003:12"/> acceptance of this his repentaunce. His firſt roabe was his firſt royaltie which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, and Chriſt redeemed for vs. The ſeruaunts who did fetch it were the miniſters of his holie worde, who bring his graces to vs. The ring was the ſeale of Gods holy ſpirit, and a token of his dignity: whereby he crieth <hi>Abba father,</hi> and is ſealed vnto the day of redemption. The ſhooes of his feete were the preparation of the Goſpell of peace. The fat Calfe that was killed, was Chriſt ſlaine from the beginning of the worlde, for him and vs all his prodigal children. The heauenly banket, mirth, and muſicke is the ioy and happines which we ſhal bee partakers of in the kingdome of heauen, all which ſhall bee orderlie prooued vnto vs in their proper places.</p>

               <p>What faith this man hath, appeareth by his wordes: For after hee acknowledged his fathers bountie to his hired ſeruants, he harteneth himſelfe with the hope of greater kindneſſe, to bee exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded towardes him vppon his returne, beeing a ſonne. And therefore premiſing and meditating vppon this: <hi>Howe manie hyred ſeruauntes in my Fathers houſe haue bread enough, and I die for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi> Hee cheereth himſelfe with a confidence of comfort, ſaying to himſelfe, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee placed his wordes in verie good ranke ſpeaking to great purpoſe, to mooue affections. <hi>I: a Sonne. They: Seruauntes. They: haue enough.</hi> I: <hi>die for hunger.

Therefore it muſt needes bee well with me, if I returne home, as it is with them, who are now at home. I wil therefore hie me home, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before my father.</p>
               <p>Wherfore vnto the true repentance of our ſinne, conſequentlie of neceſsitie, a true faith muſt bee adioyned, which onelie diſcerneth trueth from falſehoode, true repentance from hypocriſie, which ſtayeth it ſelfe wholie vppon the worde of GOD, the foundation thereof, this word being the argument, and ſubiect of our faith. If therefore we do repent, and bewaile our ſinnes: it is manifeſt that we are moued, and touched with Gods word,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6003:75"/> that it hath pricked our hearts. And this good tree cannot but bring forth good fruit, it cannot be idle in the harts of the faithful.</p>
               <p>In this reſpect, learned men do make Faith, and Contrition, the two eſſential parts and members of repentance. Contrition, whereby we repent that is paſt: and faith wherby we hope of grace to come. Wee goe not ſo fa re with them, as to make faith a part of repentance: but wee hold it needefull that it bee matched with repentance, that it goe hande in hand with it, that it be not diuorced and diuided from it.

So faith and repentaunce goe togither in the faithfull, and are not ſeparated; yet one of them is not a member of the other: faith is ioyned to it as the originall of it, the only motiue of it, like vnto a Captaine that giueth the onſet.

               <p>From the firſt roote, ſpringeth theſe branches. His calling vs by his worde, whereby hee teacheth vs his will and our duetie. His priuate admonitions which are either giuen vs by our friendes for our good, in kindneſſe to winne vs; or elſe by our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, in their bitter affections, verie forcible in regarde of the hurt they intende vs, of themſelues to reclaime vs. Adde hereto his puniſhmentes, his ſignes of anger, his moſt dreadfull iudgments, which are infinite and vnſpeakeable ſhewed in the heauen, the water, and the earth, all which are ſounde alarums and loude thunderpeales, to rouſe vs out of the deade ſleepe and ſecuritie, in which we liue.</p>

Of the which purpoſing peculiarlie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate in his fit place, in the third Booke, vpon the occaſion offered by his fathers ſeeing him a farre off, I leaue it at this time: for our drift is now to ſhew the vertue, force, and manifold vſe, of his outwarde iudgements, what deepe impreſsions they make in mens affections, altering and reclaiming their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>The fulneſſe of bread, and aboundance of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which this yong man had at will in his fathers
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:6003:77"/> houſe, puffed him vp with pride, made him wilde and wanton, and bred in him a loathſomneſſe and contempt of them. Hereupon he gaue himſelfe to all riot and exceſſe, he became a trauailer, ſpending without ceaſing, without order and diſcretion, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till all his portion and patrimonie was conſumed. Immediatelie he came to a lowe ebbe, he fell ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly into all calamitie, and this affliction gaue him vnderſtanding, and wrought his conuerſion. For being in the toppe and height of his proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, God firſt of all puniſhed him with want and ſcarcitie, whereby hee that bought the conſtrained courteſies of manie mens knees, with the expences of ſo manie pounds being out of his money, he was out of requeſt: they who before did reuerence him as a God, did now reiect him and deſpiſe him as a dogge. Forthwith ſlauerie ouertooke his beggerie, his bondage as moſt noyſome, ſo was it moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſſome, for it brought leanneſſe euen vppon his ſoule, one might tell all his bones, and his ſtrength failed him, beeing now forgotten as a deade man, and vtterlie forſaken.

               <p>Theſe meanes God vſed as motiues to ſtirre vp his dull ſpirits, and to quicken him a freſh, to pluck him by the eares, and to lift him vp from his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

               <p>Therefore becauſe this title was ſo encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, and ſo full life, it was with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that this comfortleſſe and almoſt dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, did take holde of this as the Citie of refuge, and hornes of the altar, by which he might be ſure to eſcape further vengeance, and the handes of the deſtroier.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, it could not be, but that the memory of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> his father did put him in mind of the duty of a ſon, for it ſerueth effectually to that end.

               <p>Here is a great exchange in this man.

A ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo liueth as if God had no eyes to ſee him, or eyeliddes to conſider him, but when he ſhall return to a better mind he ſhall put off this fooliſhnes, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:6003:95"/> acknowledge with himſelfe that the Lord doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, and that there is no ſinne that can be hid from him. And if with this man we come to this good thought that God ſeeth our ſinnes, it will teach vs more conſcience, and reſtraine vs from ſuch deſperate and preſumptuous ſinnes, which ſo rifelie we commit, and mak vs walke more warily.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue hitherto diſcuſſed diuers main pointes of rare and ſtrange fauour, ſhewed by the father to his ſonne a far off, and ſomewhat we haue ſpoken of his geſtures, and actions of loue towards him when he drew nigh vnto him: but now far greater remain to be intreated of, admirably expreſſed when hee was in preſence with him.</p>
               <p>Now had he fit time, and iuſtice required it, and his ſonnes ſinnes deſerued it, that he ſhould rip vp vnto him his defaults paſt, and cal to his reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance the offences of his youth, to call him to account of the time miſpent, and to lay open the booke of conſcience before him.</p>
               <p>Some ſeuere father if he had ſuch a ſonne, would haue ratled him roundly, and woulde haue either conſtrained himſelfe to ſeeme inexorable, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would not haue accepted of him, but vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Hee ſuffereth him not to conclude his ſpeech, though he knew wel enough that he had not much to ſpeake. He ſhould haue ſpoken on, and ſaide as hee purpoſed, <hi>Make mee one of thy hired ſeruants,</hi> but the father interrupteth him by his haſty calling to his ſeruants for him, giuing more then hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would haue requeſted, or his mind conceiued.

               <p>He would thus cloath him, to ſhew vs what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he maketh of him, how highly hee honoreth him as his owne darling, though the other woulde haue ſued to be but his hyreling.</p>
               <p>He willeth his officers to fetch him the beſt or the firſt roabe,<note place="margin">His roabe what it was.</note> and to adorne him with it.

               <p>With this roabe was <hi>Adam</hi> firſt inueſted, but by his wilful departure from his father, he was ſtripped of it: So as we his ſonnes who do treade in his ſteps, are ſubiect to his miſeries, and may with him bee aſhamed of our nakednes.</p>

               <p>Rings ſerue eſpeciallie to a double purpoſe. Firſt to bee as ornaments of honour<note place="margin">A ring an ornament of honour.</note> and renowne. For which cauſe in olde times the Romanes when they ſent their honourable Embaſſadours into forraine kingdomes, they had rings giuen them in the publike ſight and face of the people, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as teſtimonials of their honorable callings, and of the dignitie and great worſhip which was layde vpon them. It was not then lawfull for anie to weare rings who had them not by publique com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion giuen vnto them. Of later times a Ring peculiarlie appertayned to the famous order and degree of knighthoode, to diſtinguiſh them from the confuſed and common ſort of people. It was not ſufferable in a baſe borne brat, to go brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging with a ring, no man might weare any that was not free borne. Moreouer it was not permitted to any to haue more then one, yea it was infamous &amp; verie ridiculous to weare more then one. <hi>Gracchus</hi> noted <hi>Naeuius</hi> for a wanton fellow of moſt effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate behauiour, foraſmuch as his left hand was ſo painted and gawdie, and daubed with rings. It was alwayes the cuſtome to weare the ring vpon the next finger vnto the leaſt vpon the left hande, to bee in ſteade of a Diademe and Coronet vpon the toppe of the hart, the fountaine of all vertue, for aſmuch as a ſinewe from thence extendeth it ſelfe vnto the heart, and therefore that the Ring was a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:6003:127"/> ſigne of vertue this ancient cuſtome ſheweth.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, rings ſerued as ſeales of loue,<note place="margin">A Ring a ſeale of loue</note> and pledges of troth plighted each with other. In this reſpect it hath beene the common cuſtome of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, to declare their mutuall loue and good will, by their ioynt giuing and receiuing of rings. Their agreement of mindes, and fitnes of natures, by no other ceremonie could bee better ſhewed then by a ring which euerie one cauſeth to be made fit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be worne, for if it be too wide it ſlippeth off, or if it bee too ſtreight it pincheth too much: So conſorts and companions of our loues muſt be fit and ſutable to vs. For if they bee too looſe, they will bee too ſlippery, or if they be too ſtreight, wee cannot endure them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Rings which paſſed to and fro betweene louers, vſually were engrauen, and had ſeales vpon them.
